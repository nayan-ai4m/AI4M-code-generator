- Colors and themes can be customized in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Global styles are in `app/globals.css`
- Component-specific styles use Tailwind utility classes

### API Integration
- API endpoints are in the `app/api/` directory
- Each service has its own route handler
- Environment variables are used for API keys

### Components
- All components are in the `components/` directory
- UI components follow shadcn/ui conventions
- Custom components are modular and reusable

### Features
- Add new features by creating components and API routes
- Follow the existing patterns for consistency
- Update the UI to include new functionality

## Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set the required environment variables in your production environment:
- `GROQ_API_KEY`

### Deployment Platforms
This application can be deployed to:
- Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- Netlify

## Usage Limits & Considerations

- **API Rate Limits**: Groq API has rate limits. Monitor usage in production.
- **File Size Limits**: Current limit is 10MB for uploaded files. Adjust in `/api/upload/route.ts` if needed.
- **Security**: API keys are server-side only and never exposed to the client.
- **Cost**: Monitor API usage as Groq has usage-based pricing.
